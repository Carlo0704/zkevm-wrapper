# ZkEVM Wrapper [![test](https://github.com/0xPolygon/zkevm-wrapper/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0xPolygon/zkevm-wrapper/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repository contains the ZkEVM wrapper contracts that allows any user (including smart contracts) to transfer ETH and
ERC20 tokens to ZkEVM in a single transaction.

## Features

- Transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens to ZkEVM using traditional ERC-20 approval flow
- Transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens to ZkEVM using EIP-2612 permit signatures
- Transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens to ZkEVM using DAI-style permit signatures
  > ⚠️ **_NOTE:_** The wrapper does not support fee-on-transfer tokens and will automatically revert if the token has a transfer fee.

## Usage

- Make an approval tx to the wrapper contract with the amount of tokens you want to transfer to ZkEVM
  _or_
- Sign a EIP-2612 permit signature with the amount of tokens and appropriate deadline you want to transfer to ZkEVM
  _or_
- Sign a Dai-style permit signature with the amount of tokens and appropriate expiry and nonce you want to transfer to ZkEVM

Then,

- Call the appropriate `deposit()` function on the wrapper contract with the ether, amount of ERC-20 tokens (and signature, if any) that you want to transfer to ZkEVM
